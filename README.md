# Offline AI Personal Assistant Device

A hardware project to build a small offline home assistant similar to a Google Home device.  
The device will use a single-board computer, microphone, and speaker to listen for a wake word, process voice commands locally, and respond using an embedded lightweight AI model.  
The goal is to learn embedded systems, edge AI, audio processing, and hardware design.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a fully offline voice assistant device  
- Learn audio input/output hardware fundamentals  
- Train and run lightweight AI models on a small computer  
- Design and build a simple enclosure  
- Create a functional prototype suitable for expansion  

---

## 🧠 Main Features (Planned)
- Wake word detection  
- Local speech-to-text processing  
- Local AI-generated responses  
- Audio output through speaker  
- Simple voice commands (timers, queries, device functions)  

---

## 🛠 Hardware Overview
The device will consist of:
- A single board computer (Raspberry Pi 5 or similar)  
- USB microphone or microphone array  
- Compact speaker (USB or 3.5mm)  
- SD card for storage  
- Power supply  
- Optional: 3D printed enclosure or handmade housing  

See `PARTS.md` for the complete component list.

## 🚀 Why I’m Building This
This project lets me explore the intersection of AI, hardware engineering, and embedded systems.  
I want to understand how modern voice assistants work at a low level and build my own offline version to learn about edge computing and device design.
