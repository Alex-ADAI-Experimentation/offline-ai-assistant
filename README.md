# offline-ai-assistant
A small home assistant device that works completely offline using a single board computer, a microphone, and a speaker. It will listen for a wake word, process speech locally, and generate responses using a lightweight AI model. The project will help me learn about hardware design, embedded systems, and running AI on edge devices.
