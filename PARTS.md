## Total Estimated Budget

- **Minimum configuration** (core only): £133–£177
- **Enhanced configuration** (core + 3D case + LED): £150–£220
- **Full featured** (core + mic array + battery + display): £270–£350

All configurations fit comfortably within the £400 grant budget, with substantial headroom for upgrades and contingencies.

## Notes on Costs

- Prices in GBP, approximate as of late 2025
- Shipping costs add approximately £10 depending on suppliers
- Student discounts available through some educational platforms
- Local makerspaces may provide free/discounted 3D printing access

## Sourcing

- **Raspberry Pi products**: Pimoroni, The Pi Hut, CPC Farnell
- **Electronics components**: Amazon UK, RS Components, Farnell
- **Maker supplies**: Pimoroni, Adafruit, SparkFun
- **3D printing**: University fab labs, local makerspaces, online services (3D Hubs, Craftcloud)

## Budget Allocation Plan

For this build, I'm planning the enhanced configuration (~£220 core + extras), leaving £180 for:
- Shipping and handling (£30–£50)
- Component upgrades if testing reveals issues (£50–£80)
- Optional mic array HAT if single mic proves insufficient (£50–£60)
- Future expansion components (display, battery) (~£50)

This allocation prioritizes getting a robust working prototype while maintaining flexibility for iteration based on real-world testing.
