## Entry 1: Initial Setup (Sample)

**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Time Spent:** 2 hours  
**Work Done:**
- Unboxed Raspberry Pi 5 and all core components
- Inventoried parts against PARTS.md list (all present)
- Flashed Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, release 2024-11-19) to 64 GB SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager
- Completed first boot, set up Wi-Fi and SSH
- Ran system updates: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
- Installed Python 3.11 and pip: `sudo apt install python3-pip`

**Results:**
- System boots successfully in ~30 seconds
- SSH access working from laptop
- Python 3.11.2 installed and working

**Problems:**
- Initial Wi-Fi setup required keyboard and monitor (expected)
- System update took 25 minutes due to large package list

**Next Steps:**
- Install PyAudio and test microphone input
- Verify speaker output with test audio file
- Set up Git and clone this repository to the Pi
